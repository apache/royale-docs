Send messages to your app users

When a user is working with your application, you may need to get their attention to ask them a question, remind them of something they need to do, or update them about some app process that just completed (or broke!). [Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/) provides several components that let you get your message out, and one of them lets your app user respond.

## Alert

_Information about the Alert component will appear here_

## Examples
[Tour de Jewel](https://royale.apache.org/tourdejewel/#){:target="_Blank"} is not just an excellent resource for not seeing what various Royale components can do. You can also review the code for each sample online, or download it so you can study it in detail and adapt it to your project.

Tour de Jewel has examples of the three ways of alerting your app users or asking them questions:

 * Alert: four examples of increasing complexity (don't miss the one in the footer!)
 * Popup: modal and non-modal examples
 * Snackbar: seven examples showing off how you can customize snackbar look and behavior
