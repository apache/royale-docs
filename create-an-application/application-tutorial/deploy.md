# Run the application

Running the application in a browser

Assuming you followed the typical directory and file pattern, and the MXML file was in a `src` directory, next to the `src` directory should be a `bin` directory with a `js-debug` directory inside it.

Inside the `js-debug` directory is an `index.html` file. You can open it in your browser and you should see the list of commits appear.

You should see something like this:

<iframe frameborder="no" border="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" 
width="100%" height="350" 
src="assets/application-tutorial/index.html"></iframe>

Or maybe the commits won't appear. In fact, many browsers will not run this app successfully. Let's figure out why.
