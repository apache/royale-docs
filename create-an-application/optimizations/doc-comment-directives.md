## (Optimization options)  
# Doc-Comment Directives  


Warning:  This document is a work-in-progress/undergoing review.  


These settings are actionscript code level settings. They are implemented in the form of instructions to the compiler based on doc-comment tags, frequently as annotations against members of classes.
They are always in the format 
 **@royale{name here}**
 
They have no case variation (all lower case, not camel case, for example) and may have arguments that follow after some white space. They are fully expressed on a single line, and a newline terminates them.

## Suppress Warnings  

### @royalesuppresspublicvarwarning {#royalesuppresspublicvarwarning}  
This is used to suppress warning output by the compiler.

public variables are not protected from renaming optimizations by javascript in a way that permits them to continue to be accessible via dynamic access.
This means that for:

```as3
class MyThing {  
    public var myImportantVar:String = 'myValue';  
}
```

```as3
var myThing:MyThing = new MyThing();
var s:String = myThing.myImportantVar; //this always works
var fieldName:String = 'myImportantVar';
s = myThing[fieldName]; //this will work in a js-debug build, but may not work in js-release
```

Because of issues like the above, the Royale compiler outputs a warning to alert the developer.
However in many cases, the dynamic access may not be needed, and using a public var will be fine.
To prevent the warning from the compiler, the doc comment directive can be used as follows:

```as3
/**
 * @royalesuppresspublicvarwarning
 */
public var myImportantVar:String = 'myValue';
```

## Output Optimizations

### @royaleigorecoercion type {#royaleigorecoercion} 

Used for: performance tuning, code size tuning.  

The `as` keyword in ActionScript has two purposes. The first is to tell the compiler to accept a value as a specific type even if it's ambiguous. This is called a compile-time coercion. ActionScript also supports run-time coercion of types. If runtime coercion is enabled, the type of an object is coerced to the specified type. If the object is not of the specified type, the assigned value will be nullified. This runtime check comes with a cost to code size and runtime performance/complexity.

If runtime coercion is not needed, the `@royaleigorecoercion` option can be used. It can help avoid unnecessary code and improve performance.

A simplistic, illustrative example is:

```as3
if (myVar is MyClass) { //this generates code to check if myVar is of type 'MyClass'
    (myVar as MyClass).myClassMethod(); 
    //the above normally generates similar code to check if myVar is of type 'MyClass'
    //or a subclass of MyClass, and if it is not, treats it as null
    MyClass(myVar).myOtherClassMethod(); 
    //the above normally generates similar code to check if myVar is of type 'MyClass'
    //or a subclass of MyClass, and if it is not, throws an error
}
```

In both the above examples, the outer conditional `myVar is MyClass` check already assures us that myVar resolves to 'MyClass' as a type.  
So the extra overhead of code that performs `myVar as MyClass` or `MyClass(myVar)` coercions is redundant, because we can already be sure it will resolve successfully.  
If the definition of MyClass is in a package called mypackage, then its **fully qualified name** is mypackage.MyClass.  
The following can then be used to avoid the redundant (as described above) javascript output code:

```as3
/**
 * @royaleigorecoercion mypackage.MyClass
 */
```

* * *
### @royaleemitcoercion type {#royaleemitcoercion} 

The flipside of `@royaleigorecoercion` is used to emit `as` coercions even when the `-js-output-optimization=skipAsCoercions` option is enabled. In the Royale framework code we use `@royaleemitcoercion` even though the compiler is set to emit the coercions because it's an explicit statement that coercions are necessary.

* * *
### @royalesuppressresolveuncertain optional_arg {#royalesuppressresolveuncertain} 

Used for: performance tuning, code size tuning.  
This is a local variation for controlling specificity of the corresponding compiler configuration setting '-js-resolve-uncertain'.  
Please read the [Strict equality comparisons](create-an-application/optimizations/compiler-configuration-settings.html#strict-equality-comparisons) section of [Compiler Configuration Settings](create-an-application/optimizations/compiler-configuration-settings.html) for general information about this setting.


How to use:  
A simplistic example is:

```as3
/**
 * setting goes here
 */
public function testResolveUncertain():void {
    var myClass:Class = int;
    if (new myClass(30) === 30) trace('it worked!);
    var myOtherClass:Class = String;
    if (new myOtherClass('test') === 'test') trace('it worked again!);
}
```

In the above example, both of 'new myClass(30)' and 'new myOtherClass('test')' will have extra code to cover the cases where variations occur in javascript.

**@royalesuppressresolveuncertain false**  

Using the above setting, if the compiler configuration setting is -js-resolve-uncertain=false, then the above annotation will override that locally to turn it on (true). 
This only affects the code scope of the annnotated method definition.

**@royalesuppressresolveuncertain true**  
or simply:  
**@royalesuppressresolveuncertain**  
Both of the above settings will be the same as '-js-resolve-uncertain=false' for the annotated method's code scope.

**@royalesuppressresolveuncertain myClass**  
Using the above setting, if the compiler configuration setting is -js-resolve-uncertain=true, then the above annotation will override that locally to turn it off (false) only for the myClass Class variable and not for the myOtherClass Class variable. 


* * * 

### @royalesuppressvectorindexcheck optional_arg {#royalesuppressvectorindexcheck} 

Used for: performance tuning, code size tuning.  
This is a local variation for controlling specificity of the corresponding configuration setting '-js-vector-index-checks'.  

Please read the [Vector Index Checking](create-an-application/optimizations/compiler-configuration-settings.html#vector-index-checking) section of [Compiler Configuration Settings](create-an-application/optimizations/compiler-configuration-settings.html) for general information about this setting.

How to use:
A simplistic example is:  

```as3
/**
 * setting goes here
 */
public function myTest():void {
    var vi:Vector.<int> = new <int>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
    vi[8] = 0; 
    //index 8 above is too high
    //by default this will throw a RangeError, but if 
    //@royalesuppressvectorindexcheck is used to suppress index checking,
    //no runtime error would be thrown in javascript.
}
```

**@royalesuppressvectorindexcheck false**

In the above case, if the compiler configuration setting is *-js-vector-index-checks=false*, then the above annotation will override that locally to turn it on (true). 
This only affects the code scope of the annnotated method definition.

**@royalesuppressvectorindexcheck true**  
or simply:   
**@royalesuppressvectorindexcheck**

Both of the above settings will be the same as '-js-vector-index-checks=false' for the annotated method's code scope.

**@royalesuppressvectorindexcheck vi**

In the above case, the effect is as if there was a '-js-vector-index-checks=false' setting applied specifically to any Vector with a variable name of 'vi'


* * *  

### @royalesuppresscompleximplicitcoercion optional_arg {#royalesuppresscompleximplicitcoercion} 

Used for: performance tuning, code size tuning.  
This is a local variation for controlling specificity of the corresponding configuration setting '-js-complex-implicit-coercions'.  
Please read the [Implict Coercions of non-primitive types](create-an-application/optimizations/compiler-configuration-settings.html#implicit-complex-coercions) section in [Compiler Configuration Settings](create-an-application/optimizations/compiler-configuration-settings.html) for general information about this setting if you have not already done so.  
How to use:

A simplistic example is:

```as3
/**
 * setting goes here
 */
public function testComplexImplicitCoercion():void {
    var something:* = new Cat();
    var myDog:Dog = something;
}
```

In the above example, the default output will have extra code generated in javascript, that would be similar in actionscript to:  
`var myDog:Dog = Dog(something);`

**@royalesuppresscompleximplicitcoercion false**

Using the above setting, if the compiler configuration setting is -js-complex-implicit-coercions=false, then the above annotation will override that locally to turn it on (true).  
This only affects the code scope of the annnotated method definition.  

**@royalesuppresscompleximplicitcoercion true**  
or simply:  
**@royalesuppresscompleximplicitcoercion**   
Both of the above settings will be the same as '-js-complex-implicit-coercions=false' for the annotated method's code scope.  

**@royalesuppresscompleximplicitcoercion Dog**  
Note that in this example, Dog is a top level class (top level package). Otherwise it needs the fully qualified class name.  
Using the above setting, if the compiler configuration setting is -js-complex-implicit-coercions=true, then the above annotation will override that locally to turn it off (false) only for the implicit coercions involving the Dog class.  
As another example, if the definition of Dog is in a package called myanimals, then its fully qualified name is myanimals.Dog, and it should be expressed as follows:  
**@royalesuppresscompleximplicitcoercion myanimals.Dog**

## Miscellaneous  

The following are intended mainly for use by framework developers, but are documented here for completeness. In most cases these are not recommended for use in applications.
They may be helpful in specific cases *when used with caution* for library development.
 
### @royalesuppressexport {#royalesuppressexport}  
The above is used to prevent a public class member from having an exported setting in the release build.
This can be used with classes that are used to emulate certain as3 language features in javascript, and often are intended only for output generated by the compiler and not used directly by a developer.
It has the effect to making the annotated class member 'pay as you go' because if the compiler does not generate output that uses it, the code and any dependencies that are specific to it are eliminated from the release build output.
They can also be used as another way to offer opt-in features, for a type of [PAYG](features/PAYG) approach that works in regular actionscrip, and which could also be then supported in code via a [beads](features/strands-and-beads) for use in [MXML](features/mxml).
An example of this is the ExtraData class in the Reflection library, which has static methods to add opt-in support for additional reflection data.
 
### @royalesuppressclosure {#royalesuppressclosure} 
The above is used to suppress closure generation inside a method scope of a class member.
This breaks normal as3 behavior in the javascript output, and is only rarely needed in cases where there is an advantage to use it to generate javascript that treats the ***this*** reference differently in the generated code.
An example of its usage is in the default Vector emulation code for javascript.
Recommendation: use with caution and test extensively.
