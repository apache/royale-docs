# Component Sets

Sets of components and containers designed in [Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/).

[Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/) provides its own component sets that support developing simple, small and fast applications for prototyping and as the basis of complete application user interfaces:

- [Basic](component-sets/basic) is the smallest, fastest and most [PAYG](features/payg) set of components possible in Royale, and is used by other sets like Jewel as its base.

- [Jewel](component-sets/jewel) is focused in look and feel and new practices present in modern development like responsivness and multiplatform support. Jewel supports Themes and works well on a wide range of desktop and mobile devices.

- [MXRoyale](component-sets/mxroyale) contains emulations of Flex's UIComponent and other MX components.

- [SparkRoyale](component-sets/sparkroyale) contains emulations of Flex Spark components.

### Incomplete component sets

Participants in the Royale project have started several component sets, such as _Express_, _MDL_, and _HTML5_, but have not built more than one or two components as proofs-of-concept.

### External component sets

Besides the component sets included in Royale, you can use just about any CSS Framework as the basis for your components. One example is [Spectrum-Royale](https://github.com/unhurdle/spectrum-royale) which uses Adobe's [Spectrum System](https://spectrum.adobe.com/).
