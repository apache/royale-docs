# Run unit tests with Apache Ant

Add a custom task for RoyaleUnit to your Apache Ant build files

## Activate the RoyaleUnit Ant task

First, we need to add a `<taskdef>` to make the `<royaleunit>` task available for use in our build file:

```xml
<taskdef resource="royaleUnitTasks.tasks" classpath="${royalesdk}/js/lib/royaleUnitTasks.jar"/>
```

Replace the `${royalesdk}` token with the path to the Apache Royale SDK on your computer.

## Run unit tests in HTML and JavaScript

To run unit tests for JavaScript with a web browser, set the `player` attribute to either `"chromium"`, `"webkit"`, or `"firefox"`. Or you can set it to `"html"`, if you don't have a browser preference. This tells the Ant task to use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) to launch a _headless_ browser that connects to using WebSockets. Set the `swf` attribute to the path to an *.html* file:

```xml
<royaleunit player="webkit" swf="${basedir}/bin/js-debug/index.html"/>
```

In the example above, we point to the *index.html* file generated by the Apache Royale compiler in *bin/js-debug*, and we specifiy that the tests should be run in WebKit.

### Custom browser executable

By default, Ant will run the unit tests in a _headless_ browser powered by [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). To run using a specific browser executable, you may specify the executable's path using the `command` attribute.

> In Royale 0.9.9 and older, Playwright was not yet supported, and Ant would launch the tests in your system's default web browser, when no command executable is specified.

In the following example, we'll run unit tests in Google Chrome.

On Windows, set the `command` to an *.exe* file:

```xml
<royaleunit player="html" swf="path/to/file.html"
	command="c:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe"/>
```

On macOS, set the `command` to the executable **inside** an *.app* package:

```xml
<royaleunit player="html" swf="${basedir}/bin/js-debug/index.html"
	command="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"/>
```

If you need to pass arguments to the executable, set the `commandArgs` attribute:

```xml
<royaleunit player="html" swf="path/to/file.html"
	command="c:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe"
	commandArgs="--no-sandbox --user-data-dir=custom_chrome_profile --no-first-run"/>
```

## Run unit tests in Adobe Flash Player

To run unit tests with Adobe Flash Player, set the `player` attribute to `"flash"`. Set the `swf` attribute to the path of a *.swf* file:

```xml
<royaleunit player="flash" swf="bin-debug/ExampleApp.swf"/>
```

The unit tests will run in your default application associated with *.swf* files. To run in a specific version of the standalone Adobe Flash Player projector, you may specify the path to the executable using the `command` attribute.

On Windows, set the `command` to an *.exe* file:

```xml
<royaleunit player="flash" swf="bin-debug/ExampleApp.html"
	command="path/to/flashplayer_32_sa_debug.exe"/>
```

On macOS, set the `command` to the executable **inside** an *.app* package:

```xml
<royaleunit player="flash" swf="bin-debug/ExampleApp.html"
	command="/Applications/Flash Player.app/Contents/MacOS/Flash Player Debugger"/>
```

## Useful options

To fail the Ant build if the unit tests fail, set the `haltonfailure` attribute to `true`:

```xml
<royaleunit player="chromium" swf="${basedir}/bin/js-debug/index.html" haltonfailure="true"/>
```
