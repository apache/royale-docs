# RoyaleUnit

A unit testing library for Apache Royale

## What RoyaleUnit does

RoyaleUnit is an extensible testing framework for ActionScript classes and provides extensions for working with the Royale Framework. The RoyaleUnit framework is used to automate unit and integration testing.

## Requirements

Apache RoyaleUnit is designed to work with [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org){:target='_blank'}, a command-line tool which can drive processes described in build files as targets and extension points dependent upon each other. The Ant website provides an overview, documentation, and a free download of the Ant installer.
