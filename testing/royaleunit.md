# RoyaleUnit

A unit testing library for Apache Royale

## What RoyaleUnit does

RoyaleUnit is an extensible testing framework for ActionScript classes and provides extensions for working with the [Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/) Framework. The RoyaleUnit framework is used to automate unit and integration testing.

## Requirements

Apache RoyaleUnit is designed to work with [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org){:target='_blank'}, a command-line tool which can drive processes described in build files as targets and extension points dependent upon each other. The Ant website provides an overview, documentation, and a free download of the Ant installer.
