# Loading External Data

Dynamic sites and real-time updates lead to good user experiences

Unless you are building a brochure-style website that makes a statement and provides contact information, you are going to be working with _data_. You will get some of that data from your site or application users, but you will probably also get a lot from outside your app or website.

[Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/) provides reliable, fast, and secure ways to get data from remote sources, and also to send data.

The following data types have built-in support:

* Raw Strings
* JSON
* [Binary](https://royale.apache.org/asdoc/#!org.apache.royale.utils/BinaryData)
* [XML](features/as3/xml)
* [AMF](working-with-data/loading-external-data/amf)

AMF is supported using either of:
* [LocalSharedObject](working-with-data/loading-external-data/localsharedobject)
* [RemoteObject](working-with-data/loading-external-data/remoteobject)

Classes which can be used for loading external data include:
* [HTTPService](working-with-data/loading-external-data/httpservice)
* [URLBinaryLoader](https://royale.apache.org/asdoc/#!org.apache.royale.net/URLBinaryLoader) for loading of any kind of binary data
* HttpRequestTask
* HttpDownloadTask

and others
