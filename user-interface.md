# User Interface (UI)

Where the user works with your app

Developers know that the data layer, the business layer, and the user interface of an apploication all need to be fast, reliable, and robust. End-users tend to focus on the user interface. It is where they interact with all the strength and subtlety of an application, and where they tend to form their opinion of an app. 

A good "user experience" includes not just getting the process result you want, but how comfortable you were working with the UI. How easy is it to do what you want to do? How "pleasant" and intuitive is the display? It is not for nothing that the title of one of the key books on user experience is _Don't Make Me Think_.

[Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/) provides tools, structures, features, and component sets that help you create a user interface that helps your end-users do what they want to do.
