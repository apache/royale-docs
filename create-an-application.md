# Create an Application

Building your first Apache Royale application

The easiest way to create an [Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/) application is to start with an existing one and modify it.  In the examples folder are several examples you can use as a starting point.  But if you want to know more about the underlying principles, read on.

This document is divided into several sections:

[Application Structure](create-an-application/application-structure) explains the important files that typically comprise an application and what they do.

[Application Tutorial](create-an-application/application-tutorial) is a step-by-step example of building an application.

[Migrate an Existing App](migrate-an-existing-app) provides strategies and techniques when migrating existing Flex apps to Royale, and how to switch to Royale if you already have a Javascript application.

[Security](create-an-application/security) provides more information about making sure hackers can't use your app to be malicous and about dealing with common security restrictions when your app wants to access external resources.

[Modules](features/modules) discusses how to break your application into pieces so it doesn't have to all get downloaded at once.  Or have the whole thing compiled at once.

[Optimizations](create-an-application/optimizations) explains some of the compiler settings and in-code doc comment directives that can be used to tune the output of javascript that Royale generates.
