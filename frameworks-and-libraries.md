# Frameworks and Libraries

Pre-written sets of code which allows for easier development of Royale-based applications.

Frameworks provide reliable templates to help you develop complex projects more easily and sustainably. Libraries are generally collections of modules and functions that focus on a particular task or theme--you might find a library to help you with scientific calculations, and another library for manipulating graphics.

## Frameworks

[Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/) itself is a framework. It can play well with other frameworks to help simplify development, especially when many people are working on the same project.

### Designed for Apache Royale:

* [Crux](libraries/crux) is a library based on Swiz. Swiz is a framework that simplifies applications and gives you Inversion of Control/Dependency Injection, Event handling, new Metadatas, simplified life cycle for asynchronous remote method invocations and many more. Swiz was developed specifically for ActionScript and Flex.

### Third party frameworks

* [PureMVC](https://github.com/PureMVC/puremvc-as3-multicore-framework/wiki){:target='_blank'} is a lightweight framework for creating applications based upon the classic Model-View-Controller design meta-pattern. Is part of [The PureMVC Framework](https://puremvc.org){:target='_blank'} that implements the same library in many other popular languages and technologies.

## Libraries

Are you new to Royale libraries? [Read what they are and how to use them](libraries/library-basics).

* There are a large number of [ActionScript3](features/as3) libraries that should "just work" when you import them into your Royale application. Others may need adjustment if they presume that your application will run on Flash, not in a modern browser.
* Use the [ExternalInterface](features/external-interface) class to connect with and use external JavaScript libraries in your Royale project.
* An even more robust method for connecting with and using external JavaScript libraries is [externs](features/externs).
* Use Adobe's [Spectrum with Royale](libraries/spectrum-royale). Spectrum supports large application ecosystems.
* You can use [Material Design Lite (MDL) with Royale](libraries/mdl-royale). MDL is a library/CSS structure that follows the Material Design principles that Google developed.
