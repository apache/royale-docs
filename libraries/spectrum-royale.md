Using the Adobe Spectrum system with Royale

[Spectrum CSS](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-css/){:target="\_blank"} is an open-source implementation of Spectrum, Adobe's design system. It includes components and resources to make applications more cohesive. Adobe has created Spectrum to support large application ecosystems that benefit from sharing design elements to provide a consistent experience for their users, and large development teams. According to [Adobe](https://spectrum.adobe.com/){:target="\_blank"}, "Spectrum provides components and tools to help product teams work more efficiently, and to make Adobeâ€™s applications more cohesive"

You can incorporate the resources of Spectrum into your [Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/) project. See [examples of Royale and Spectrum working together](https://unhurdle.github.io/spectrum-royale){:target="\_blank"} with downloadable source code.
