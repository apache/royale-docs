Use Material Design Lite with Apache Royale

Google developed _Material Design_ in 2014 as a design language. Material Design uses grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.

[Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/){:target="\_blank"}, or MDL, lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your application. It doesnâ€™t rely on any JavaScript frameworks and optimizes for cross-device use. Adding MDL to your Royale project helps you offer an accessible and pleasing user experience.

See [examples of Royale and MDL](https://transpiledactionscript.com/examples/MDLExample/){:target="\_blank"}.

[Another example](https://transpiledactionscript.com/examples/PureMVCEmployeeAdminMDL/){:target="\_blank"} shows a browsable staff list in Apache Royale and MDL.
