# MDL Royale

Google developed _Material Design_ in 2014 as a design language. Material Design uses grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.

[Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/){:target="_blank"}, or MDL, lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your application. It doesn’t rely on any JavaScript frameworks and optimizes for cross-device use. Adding MDL to your Royale project helps you offer an accessible and pleasing user experience.
