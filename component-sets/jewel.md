# Jewel

A set of modern UI components

Jewel is a themeable and responsive set of user interface components for Apache Royale to help you quickly build the front end of your applications with [ActionScript](features/as3) & [MXML](features/mxml).

It's based by design on [Basic](component-sets/basic) components. But while Basic is very strict with concepts like [PAYG](features/payg), in Jewel, while PAYG is important, when necessary we prioritize other things like responsiveness, themes and look and feel.

## Browser Support

Jewel works on the following browser and device versions:

|         	    | Browser             	| Minimum Version 	| Release Date   |

(*) This list can change depending on evolution and completion of the different components, but normally it should remain in this state.

Thanks to [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com){:target='_blank'} we created the list of minimum browser versions (*) where Apache Royale Jewel works consistently

## Generated Javascript Output

For the browsers, Apache Royale generates [ECMAScript version 5 (ES5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) standard JavaScript to ensure applications are compatible with a wide range of available browsers, including Microssoft Internet Explorer 11 (IE11).
