Methods for testing Apache Royale projects

Every developer is building something from nothing, or adapting something that may already work into a new use, on a new platform, for a new audience. At every stage of the development process, there are more unknowns than knowns.

 - You may think you have written the code clearly and correctly, but when you compile it, it runs mysteriously slowly, or fails to run at all.
 - You proudly present the current state of the application to your stakeholders, and they shake their heads and say, "But that's not at all what we asked you to build."
 - Something that was working last week, or in the most recent build, is not working at all today.
 - Users are doing things with the app that you didn't expect them to do, like putting lines of code in a text entry field, and things are blowing up everywhere.

The main defense you have against buggy code and a failed development project is testing. Test early, test often...consider trying out [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development){:target='_blank'}. 

Over time we will add pointers to general testing guides, and tips and tricks more specific to Apache Royale. Keep checking back, or consider contributing your own insights.

## Unit tests

[Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/) includes the [RoyaleUnit](testing/royaleunit) library for unit testing.
