# Royale CLI

The NPM command-line interface tool

Royale CLI is a command-line tool that makes creating and compiling applications easier for users of [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/){:target='_blank'}, the JavaScript package manager.

## Installing Royale CLI

If you have not installed [Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/) already, use this command in the command window:

```sh
npm install @apache-royale/royale-js -g
```

Then run:

```sh
npm install @apache-royale/cli -g
```

## Working with Royale CLI

For information at any time about available commands and options, run:

```sh
royale help
```

### Creating a new application

Navigate in the command window to the directory where you want to create the new application, called here `my-royale-app`, then run:

```sh
royale new my-royale-app
```

This creates a new directory structure using the name of the application, and creates a basic app with one main [MXML](features/mxml) file: `my-royale-app/src/Main.mxml`.

To review the app structure so far, navigate into the new direcctory:

```sh
cd my-royale-app
```

### Running your application

Navigate in the command window into your application's directory.

To compile and run in **debug mode**, run:

```sh
royale serve:debug
```

Royale:
  - Compiles the project in debug mode, with a source map option.
  - Starts a http server and serves the files from the `bin/js-debug` directory.
  - Opens the default browser and navigates to `http://localhost:3000`.
  - Listens to the `src` folder. When any file changes, Royale will recompile the app and reload the browser to show the updated application.
  
To compile and run in **release mode**, run:

```sh
royale serve:release
```

Royale:
  - Compiles the project in release mode.
  - Starts a http server and serves the files from the `bin/js-release` directory.
  - Opens the default browser and navigates to `http://localhost:3001`.
