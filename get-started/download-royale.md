# Download Royale

know how you can grab your bits

You can download Apache Royale via [Node Package Manager(NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/){:target='_blank'} or from mirrors of Apache releases. NPM is simpler.

## NPM

To use NPM to install Royale, use the following command line for your operating system.

### Mac

```sh
sudo npm install @apache-royale/royale-js -g
```

### Windows

```sh
npm install @apache-royale/royale-js -g
```

If you want SWF output as well as JavaScript output, install these packages instead.

### Mac

```sh
sudo npm install @apache-royale/royale-js-swf -g --foreground-scripts
```

### Windows

```sh
npm install @apache-royale/royale-js-swf -g --foreground-scripts
```

If the install completes successfully, you are ready to compile your application with Royale by using the mxmlcnpm tool from the command-line.  The NPM install should have put mxmlcnpm in your path.

## Apache Mirrors

Use the following links to get a choice of mirrors to use for your download.

[tar.gz (for Mac)](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/royale/0.9.1/binaries/apache-royale-0.9.1-bin-js.tar.gz){:target='_blank'}

[zip (for Windows)](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/royale/0.9.1/binaries/apache-royale-0.9.1-bin-js.zip){:target='_blank'}


If you want SWF output as well as JavaScript output, download one of these packages instead.

[tar.gz (for Mac)](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/royale/0.9.1/binaries/apache-royale-0.9.1-bin-js-swf.tar.gz){:target='_blank'}

[zip (for Windows)](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/royale/0.9.1/binaries/apache-royale-0.9.1-bin-js-swf.zip){:target='_blank'}

Once downloaded, uncompress the file into a folder somewhere.  This folder will be referred to as the SDK folder throughout the documentation.  If you chose the package with SWF support, you will need to follow the instructions in the README to install libraries from Adobe System Inc or use the Apache Ant script `InstallAdobeSDKs.xml` by running from the SDK folder:

```sh
ant -f InstallAdobeSDKs.xml
```

At this point, you should be able to run the `js/bin/mxmlc` compiler from your Royale SDK folder to compile a Royale application.  See the [Hello World](get-started/hello-world) section for more details.
