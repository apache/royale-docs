Software tools to help you while developing Royale code

You can just use any standard text editor to write Royale applications and the command-line to compile them, but you may find that an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) can make you even more productive.

## IDEs

IDEs that support Apache Royale provide getting-started instructions to help you specify using Royale for a new project, or importing an existing Royale project.

### IDEs with Royale support

- [Visual Studio Code with ActionScript and MXML Extensions](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/vscode-nextgenas/wiki/Install-the-ActionScript-and-MXML-extension-for-Visual-Studio-Code){:target='_blank'}
- [Moonshine IDE](http://moonshine-ide.com){:target='_blank'}

### IDES that supported Flex and work with Royale with some restrictions and limitations.

- [Adobe Flash Builder](https://www.adobe.com/products/flash-builder-standard.html){:target='_blank'}
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/){:target='_blank'}
- [FDT](https://fdt.powerflasher.com){:target='_blank'}
- [Flash Develop](https://www.flashdevelop.org){:target='_blank'}

## Command-line scripts

To run the compiler, run the js/bin/mxmlc tool in the Royale SDK. The [Download Royale](get-started/download-royale) and [Hello World](get-started/hello-world) sections provide guidance about how to use the compiler.

Royale provides [Royale CLI](get-started/royale-cli), a tool to simplify creating and compiling applications for those using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/){:target='_blank'}.

## Apache Maven

You can use Apache Maven to compile your Royale application. Visit the [Apache Maven Project](https://maven.apache.org){:target='_blank'} to learn more about Maven. Each of the examples in the examples folder is set up to be built with Maven, and the archetypes folder contains **Maven Archetypes**.

## Apache Ant

You can use Apache Ant to compile your Royale application. Visit the [Apache Ant Project](https://ant.apache.org){:target='_blank'} to learn more about Ant. Each of the examples in the examples folder is set up to be built with Ant.

## asconfigc

You can use asconfigc to compile your Royale application. Visit the [asconfigc github project](https://github.com/BowlerHatLLC/asconfigc){:target='_blank'} to learn more about asconfigc. Each of the examples in the examples folder is set up to be built with asconfigc.

## Apache Cordova

Apache Cordova enables Royale applications to run on mobile devices, tablets, and even desktops. The MobileTrader example in examples/royale/MobileTrader and a few other examples use Cordova. Visit the [Apache Cordova project](https://cordova.apache.org){:target='_blank'} to learn more about using Cordova.
