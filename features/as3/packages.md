# ActionScript Packages

Packages in ActionScript 3

Code in ActionScript is structured the same way Java code is structured. Each ActionScript file must declare its package and wrap any externally visible class in the package. A top level package does not need a name. So for a `Foo` class at the top level, it would look like this:

```as3
package {
    class Foo {
        public function Foo() {
        }
    }
}
```

You can name your folder structure any way you like, but an accepted convention is to nest it in a unique domain to prevent potential package conflicts. So for a class `MyFoo` you might have a folder structure like this: `src/com/acme/MyFoo.as` and the class would look like this:

```as3
package com.acme {
    class MyFoo {
        public function MyFoo() {
        }
    }
}
```

Always structure your packages, so all classes have a unique qualified path.
