# Abstract classes in ActionScript

-allow-abstract-classes

[Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/){:target='_blank'} adds support for declaring `abstract` classes in [ActionScript](features/as3). An abstract class cannot be instantiated using the `new` keyword, meaning that it must be subclassed. Additionally, an abstract class may declare `abstract` methods that do not have a function body. Abstract methods must be implemented by the concrete subclass, similar to how the methods of an interface must also be implemented.

_Requires Apache Royale 0.9.6 or newer._

## Compiler option

Royale enables abstract classes by default. To disable abstract classes in your application, use the `-allow-abstract-classes` compiler option.

```sh
mxmlc -allow-abstract-classes=false MyApp.mxml
```

## Code example

Consider the following code that creates a class named `GraphicsObject`:

```as3
package
{
	public abstract class GraphicsObject
	{
		public function GraphicsObject()
		{
		}

		public var x:Number;
		public var y:Number;

		public abstract function draw(context:IGraphicsContext):void;
	}
}
```

This class uses the `abstract` modifier, so if we tried to instantiate the class directly, we'd get a compile-time error:

```as3
// Error: Abstract classes cannot be instantiated with the new operator.
var object:GraphicsObject = new GraphicsObject();
```

The `GraphicsObject` class defines a method named `draw()` that also uses the `abstract` modifier. This method does not have a body, and it will need to be implemented in a subclass.

> The `IGraphicsContext` type used by the single parameter of `draw()` is a hypothetical interface that (for the purposes of this example) we'll say has two methods, named `moveTo()` and `lineTo()`.

The next code sample shows how to extend the abstract class `GraphicsObject` and implement its `draw()` method:


```as3
package
{
	public class Rectangle extends GraphicsObject
	{
		public function Rectangle(width:Number, height:Number)
		{
			this.width = width;
			this.height = height;
		}

		public var width:Number;
		public var height:Number;

		public abstract function draw(context:IGraphicsContext):void
		{
			context.moveTo(x, y);
			context.lineTo(x + width, y);
			context.lineTo(x + width, y + height);
			context.lineTo(x, y + height);
			context.lineTo(x, y);
		}
	}
}
```

If we extended `GraphicsObject` and did not implement its abstract method, we'd get a compile-time error:


```as3
package
{
	// Error: Method draw in abstract class GraphicsObject not implemented by class Foobar
	public class Foobar extends GraphicsObject
	{
		public function Foobar()
		{
		}
	}
}
```

## Limitations of abstract classes in Royale

Checking whether a class is abstract happens at compile-time only. However, by using reflection APIs, a developer could potentially gain access to an abstract class and instantiate it at run-time without errors.

If a SWC library contains abstract classes, applications using that library must also enable abstract classes before the compiler will enforce any restrictions.

Other ActionScript compilers, such as the one in the [Apache Flex SDK](https://flex.apache.org/){:target='_blank'}, may not recognize or enforce abstract classes. Attemping to pass source code or SWC libraries that contain abstract classes to another compiler may result in compile-time errors or unexpected behavior at run-time. In other words, to write 100% portable ActionScript code that works with any compiler, avoid using abstract classes and any of Royale's other [extensions to the ActionScript language](features/as3#new-actionscript-language-features-in-royale).
