# Code Conventions

Coding standards for writing code in ActionScript 3

*Warning:  This document is not complete.*

## Packages

Packages have `lower.case.names` separated by periods, if needed. Names using `mixedCase` (starting with lower case) are ok, but short package names are preferred so that you aren't tempted to mixCase.

## Classes

Classes have `MixedCase` names starting with a capital letter (and no hyphens). If a name contains an acronym, each letter in the acronym should be entirely capitalized, like HTML in `HTMLElement`.

## Constants

Constants have `CAPITALIZED_NAMES` with words separated by underscore (`_`) characters.

## Properties

Properties have `mixedCase` names starting with a lower case letter.

## Events

Event strings have `mixedCase` names starting with a lower case letter.

## Event Classes

While Apache Flex had lots of event classes, Royale strives to have as few as possible since each class has download overhead. Royale has an `Event` which has an event name in the `type` field and no other payload. A `ValueEvent` contains one item that might be of interest to the listener. `ValueChangeEvent` has `oldValue`/`newValue`. There may be a `StringEvent` and other "typed" event classes.

Event constants go in the class that will dispatch the event. Thus the developer only has to import one class and write the code that uses it.

The reason behind this change is partly that JavaScript runtimes don't really type-check event instances. Royale has code that will do the type-checking, but it is pretty rare to have to discriminate between event classes. So it is best to turn off type-checking code in Royale.

To compare:

### Flex

```as3
public class TimerEvent {
  public const TIMER:String = "timer";
}

public class Timer {
   dispatchEvent(new TimerEvent(TimerEvent.TIMER));
}
```

Usage:

```as3
import TimerEvent;
import Timer;

var timer:Timer = new Timer();
timer.addEventListener(TimerEvent.TIMER, timerHandler);

function timerHandler(event:TimerEvent):void
{
}
```

### Royale

```as3
public class Timer {
   public const TIMER:String = "timer";
   dispatchEvent(new Event(TIMER));
}
```

Usage:

```as3
import Timer;

var timer:Timer = new Timer();
timer.addEventListener(Timer.TIMER, timerHandler);

function timerHandler(event:Event):void
{
}
```
