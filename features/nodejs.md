# Node.js and Apache Royale

Compile AS3 code to JS and run on Node.js

[Apache Royale](https://royale.apache.org/) can transpile [ActionScript](features/as3) to JavaScript and run on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). In this way you get all the benefits of AS3 language in Node. Check the following topics to get started:

 * [Command line scripting](features/nodejs/scripting) explains how to call Node.js APIs from ActionScript, compile to JavaScript, and run the generated script from the command line.

 * [Node.js modules](features/nodejs/modules) explains how to compile a Node.js module with ActionScript that can be loaded with `require()` and deployed to the npm registry.

 * [External modules](features/nodejs/external-modules) explains how to use third-party modules installed from the npm registry in ActionScript.
